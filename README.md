Description:
--------------
- Raincloud is a simple, easy-to-use weather web application where you can find your local weather data by entering your city, zip code or coordinates.
- The web application was developed using Python's Django framework, HTML and CSS. Raincloud features a minimal, sleek design to present the user with the data they are looking for, and nothing else. Adobe XD was used to design the front-end of the application.
