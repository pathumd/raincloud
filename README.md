Description:
--------------
- Designed and implemented a weather web application called Raincloud where I sought to provide live weather reports for any given city, zip code, and coordinates using Python, the Django framework and the OpenWeather API.
- After compiling the required weather data, I used front-end tools such as HTML and CSS to create an aesthetic platform to present this data.
- To transform Raincloud into a simple and user-friendly weather web app, I employed Adobe XD to develop a minimal and modern user interface for the application.
- Live demo: https://pathum65.pythonanywhere.com/
